EliseAI,0.0,"New York, NY",AI Operations Specialist - Healthcare,"About EliseAI

EliseAI develops cutting-edge conversational AI technology for industries fundamental to our lives: housing and healthcare. Everything is built on the foundation of health and home. Broken systems or ineffective processes in these domains have a disproportionate impact on our quality of life and society’s overall wellbeing. Conversely, any solution or technology that solves problems in these areas will have an impact that ripples far beyond them.

That’s the only kind of impact we are interested in having at EliseAI. If you get excited by the thought of working really hard on these kinds of problems, then EliseAI is the right place for you.

About The Role

We are looking for a AI Operations Specialist who will play a crucial role by working with the engineering and product team to ensure that our software products and applications meet the highest standards of quality before they are released to the public or implemented within an organization. Their primary responsibility is to identify defects, bugs, or any other issues that could compromise the functionality, usability, or security of the software.

Key Responsibilities

Evaluate AI-generated text for factual accuracy, relevance, potential bias, safety, and other relevant criteria

Collaborate with engineering and design team leaders to enhance tooling, identify and resolve bugs or performance bottlenecks, and conduct thorough testing of new functionalities aimed at improving the data annotation process

Performing various types of testing, such as functional testing, regression testing, integration testing, and performance testing, to assess the software's performance and functionality under different conditions

Thoroughly documenting and reporting any bugs, defects, or inconsistencies found during testing

Developing test plans, test cases, and test scripts based on project requirements and specifications

Maintaining comprehensive documentation of testing activities, including test plans, test cases, test results, and any relevant metrics or statistics

Attract top-tier talent to join our driven team

Requirements

Bachelor's degree or equivalent professional experience, with a demonstrated track record of creating and editing written communication as a core responsibility

Excellent grammar and written communication skills in English

Technical familiarity with software and development - not necessary to be a developer

Very strong attention to detail

Willingness to work in person at our office 5 days a week

Why Join

Growth and impact. It’s not often that you can get in on the ground floor of a funded (unicorn!) startup that’s scaling. That means that instead of following a playbook, you’ll be writing it. Every single day you will be challenged to identify how we can scale and execute on it. You’ll learn what works when you succeed and what doesn’t when you fail. Either way, the rest of the team will be here to support you.

Benefits

In addition to the growth and impact you’ll have at EliseAI, we offer competitive salaries along with the following benefits:

Equity in the company in the form of stock options

Medical, Dental and Vision premiums covered at 100%

Fully paid parental leave

Commuter benefits

Monthly fitness stipend

A collaborative in-office environment with an open floor plan, fully stocked kitchen, and company-paid lunch.

Job Compensation Range

The salary range for this role is $60,000 - $75,000. EliseAI offers a competitive total rewards package which includes base salary, equity, and a comprehensive benefits & perks package. Exact compensation is determined based on a number of factors including experience, skill level, location and qualifications which are assessed during the interview process.

Certain locations in the United States require job postings to include a reasonable estimate of the base salary range and/or a general description of benefits and other compensation applicable to the role.

Competitive salary plus benefits including Medical, Dental, PTO, 401k.

Glean Technologies,0.0,"Palo Alto, CA","Senior Data Scientist, EGINew","About Glean:

Founded in 2019, Glean is an innovative AI-powered knowledge management platform designed to help organizations quickly find, organize, and share information across their teams. By integrating seamlessly with tools like Google Drive, Slack, and Microsoft Teams, Glean ensures employees can access the right knowledge at the right time, boosting productivity and collaboration. The company’s cutting-edge AI technology simplifies knowledge discovery, making it faster and more efficient for teams to leverage their collective intelligence.

Glean was born from Founder & CEO Arvind Jain’s deep understanding of the challenges employees face in finding and understanding information at work. Seeing firsthand how fragmented knowledge and sprawling SaaS tools made it difficult to stay productive, he set out to build a better way - an AI-powered enterprise search platform that helps people quickly and intuitively access the information they need. Since then, Glean has evolved into the leading Work AI platform, combining enterprise-grade search, an AI assistant, and powerful application- and agent-building capabilities to fundamentally redefine how employees work.

Role

Glean is building a world-class Data Organization composed of data science, applied science, data engineering and business intelligence groups. This is a data science role based in our Palo Alto headquarters.

At Glean, data scientists collaborate with engineering, product management and design to

Define and build data assets, e.g. KPI definitions, data pipelines and dashboards, to measure the performance of AI-powered assistant products for knowledge workers.
Identify opportunities to improve these KPIs, and influence cross functional teams to incorporate associated changes into their roadmaps.
Create and maintain quantitative frameworks and methodologies, e.g. bring more rigor into experiment analyses, use statistical modeling to identify leading indicators of user growth and engagement.

You’d be embedded within a specific set of products in Glean’s large offering of search and generative AI products. These products aim to make Glean mission critical for the knowledge worker (i.e. the user) and the firm she works at (i.e. the customer).

You’d explore how Glean’s search and generative AI products should intersect. You’d explore different product modalities like web, mobile and desktop apps, as well as experiences where Glean’s embedded into other products like an internal portal or another B2B SaaS product like Slack. You’d explore how unstructured data in documents, structured data and data outside of an organization should come together. You’d look into the knowledge worker as a potential creator of generative AI experiences for others around her, rather than a mere consumer of these experiences. You’d explore knowledge workers in specific job function verticals like engineering and support. You’d think about empowering Glean’s customers to reign in the proliferated set of AI agents around them for maximum value, whether or not they are created by Glean.

At the intersection of all these domains is using product analytics to enhance a user and customer’s experience. Combined with enterprise-grade & highly performant AI, which’d be delivered by sister teams, such magical experience is the prerequisite for making Glean grow into over 1B knowledge workers out there.

Minimum qualifications:

You have a Bachelors/Masters/PhD degree in Statistics, Mathematics or Computer Science, or another quantitative field.
You have 5+ years of industry experience as a data scientist. For PhD degree holders, the minimum years of required experience as a data scientist is 2 years.
You have strong business sense, and are strong at defining good product KPIs/guardrail metrics, dashboarding and analysis of raw data to derive strategic insights.
You are familiar with BI visualization tools such as Sigma, Metabase, Tableau or Looker.
You are proficient in SQL and the modern data stack (e.g. dbt pipelines for ETL/ELT).
You are proficient in Python.
You have experience in writing source-controlled code for pipelines and internal tools for data-oriented decision making.
You are strong at statistics. You have experience in applying these skills into tangible improvements in products, internal tools and processes using A/B testing and non-experimental methods.
You are concise and precise in written and verbal communication. Technical documentation is your strong suit.

You are a particularly good fit if:

You have experience in B2B SaaS, especially in the enterprise AI space.
You have a very strong sense of ownership and self-motivation. You are laser focused on delivering business impact while growing as an individual along with Glean.
You are good at managing evolving priorities while bringing core initiatives to a success.
You have experience working with collaborators across large time zone differences.

Auto Club Of Southern Calif,0.0,"Costa Mesa, CA 92626",Lead Data Scientist,"Lead Data Scientist

As our Lead Data Scientist, you will act as an internal business consultant to help optimize every facet of this organization. You will solve problems and answer questions – using data – for other departments to help us reduce costs, reduce errors, and be a better organization for our 17 million members.

What You’ll Do

Every day, you will help solve business problems presented to us by stakeholders using data. You will get a scenario or problem, such as, “We need to reduce cycle times,” and then pull, analyze, and interpret data relevant to that scenario.

You will pull data from SQL databases. You will analyze and interpret data using Python, R, or other tools. You will determine patterns or trends and their statistical significance to the problem. To visualize the data, you will use Tableau.

Once you have done your analysis, paired with a data engineer, you will present your findings to the stakeholder and confirm, refute or simply acknowledge a hypothesis. Your work may be implemented or may develop into something else. This role is remote, but you must be able to report to the Independence, OH office for regular collaboration days.

What You’ll Need

To thrive in this role, you must have a solid foundation of statistics and data analysis. You must be able to describe a project where you pulled data, analyzed it, identified trends or patterns, determined significance, and delivered insights or recommendations to the business. What was your approach? What tools did you use and why? Did you get to the root cause of the issue? Did you confirm or refute a hypothesis? You must be able to speak to your involvement and decisions at each stage.

For pulling data, we use SQL so you must be proficient with this tool. To curate and analyze data, we use a variety of languages and programs: Python, R, and even Excel. You can choose whatever tool helps you best, but you must be proficient in either Python or R.

Excellent communication skills and an attitude of flexibility are a must. Very often, we get into the data and some aspect takes longer than we thought, or we have to pivot and change how we approach a problem. A dashboard works better than a model, perhaps. Then you have to explain to the stakeholder or the team why you made that change or why the deliverable is taking longer than expected. It’s all about being creative in your approach and communicating that frequently and clearly to people who may be less tech or data-savvy than you.

You have worked previously with an Agile team or understand these concepts. You expect to participate in daily standup meetings, you’ll complete your projects or stories during our bimonthly sprints, and you’re ready to meet frequent deployment deadlines.

The starting pay range for this position is:
$142,300.00 - $189,200.00
Additionally, for full time positions, you will be eligible to participate in our incentive program based upon the achievement of organization, team and personal performance.

Walmart,3.4,"Sunnyvale, CA 94086","Staff, Software Engineer – Conversational AI","Position Summary...

What you'll do...

Cortex Team is Walmart’s core A.I. conversational platform, powering the vision of delivering the world’s best personal assistants to Walmart’s customers, accessible via natural voice commands, text messages, rich UI interactions, and a mix of all of the above via multi-modal experiences.

We believe conversations are a natural and powerful user interface for interacting with technology and enable a richer customer experiences – both online and in-store. We are building and designing the next generation of Natural Language Understanding (NLU) services that other teams can easily integrate and leverage, and build rich experiences: from pure voice and text shopping assistants (Siri, Sparky), to customer care channels, to mobile apps with rich, intertwined, multi-modal interaction modes (Me@Walmart).

Interested in diving in?

We need solid engineers with the talent and expertise required to design, build, improve and evolve our capabilities in at least some of the following areas:

Service oriented architecture in charge of exposing our NLU capabilities at scale, and enabling increasingly sophisticated model orchestration.
Since the service takes in traffic for a large set of Walmart customers (that is 80% of American households!), you will get to solve non trivial challenges in terms of service scalability and availability.
You will design and build the primitives to efficiently orchestrate model-serving microservices, taking into account their dependencies, and improving the combined latency and robustness of such microservices (e.g. fan out in parallel to N services for a single request, and reply with whichever gives the fastest answer).
You will also bake-in functionality which can drive improved machine learning modeling and experimental design, such as A/B testing.
Model serving and operations
There is a constant tension between model improvements (more computations) and model serving latency. So, we are always in a quest of crunching more numbers, while preserving our SLAs, and controlling the operational costs.
You will guide our efforts to always find the best tradeoffs in terms of architecture, tooling (Tensorflow serving? / VLLM? / Triton?) and infrastructure (CPU? / GPU?, GCP? / Azure?) for model serving – based on the latest model developments and product requirements.
In particular, you will drive principled and scientific load-testing efforts, to clearly identify the tradeoffs at hands, and tune/optimize the model-serving stack.
If interested, you will also get some opportunity to work on prompt engineering and agentic systems.
Tooling, infrastructure and pipelines for reproducible workflow and models, enabling rapid innovation across the entire product lifecycle.
You will author and maintain pipelines that safely build and deploy models to production via continuous deployment.
You will achieve scalable and efficient resource management capabilities (cloud infrastructure).
You will provide robust and built-in diagnostics for quality control throughout.
You will integrate – or build – labeling tools which can seamlessly integrate at the heart of our conversation data store (GCP, BigQuery) and intertwine multiple labeling sources of various confidence levels.

Come at the right time, and you will have an enormous opportunity to make a massive impact on the design, architecture, and implementation of an innovative, mission critical product, used every day, by people you know, and which customers love.

As part of the emerging tech group, you will also have the additional opportunity of building demos, proof of concepts, creating white papers, writing blogs, etc.

Note that this is not a fully remote job, you are required to come to the office (currently at least 2 days a week).

Minimum Qualifications

Deep hands-on technical expertise in full-stack development.
Programming experience with at least one modern language with an efficient runtime, such as Scala, Java, C++, or C#.
Experience with at least one relational database technology such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, or MS SQL.
Some level of fluency in Python (lingua-franca of our data-scientists).
Understanding of the challenge of distributed data-processing at scale.
Deal well with ambiguous/undefined problems; ability to think abstractly.
Ability to take a project from scoping requirements through actual launch.
A continuous drive to explore, improve, enhance, automate, and optimize systems and tools.
Capacity to apply scientific analysis and mathematical modeling techniques to predict, measure and evaluate the consequences of designs and the ongoing success of our platform.
Excellent oral and written communication skills.
Bachelor’s degree or certification in Computer Science, Engineering, Mathematics, or any other related field.

Preferred Qualifications

Affinity for prompt engineering
Large scale distributed systems experience, including scalability and fault tolerance.
Experience taking a leading role in building complex data-driven software systems successfully delivered to customers
